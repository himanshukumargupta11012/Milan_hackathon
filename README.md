# Milan_hackathon

## Getting started
To get started, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also you will need to configure the environment variables. To do this, create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project. Follow the .env_sample file in the backend folder to configure the environment variables.

## Running the code
To run the code, switch over to the backend directory and run the following command:
```
flask run
```
Your flask server will be up and running on port 5000. You can head over to your browser and start exploring.

## Tech stack
We are using,  
  --  Flask for the Backend  
  -- Sqlite for the Database 
  -- Tailwind CSS, Jquery, graph.js for the Frontend
