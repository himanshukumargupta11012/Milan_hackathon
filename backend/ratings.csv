10,Coffee ,2,"Coffee was weak, need that caffeine punch!"
11,Panipuri ,2,"Panipuri was a letdown, lacked the zing I was hoping for. The tanginess was missing, and the spiciness was just not there. Perhaps a different vendor might do justice to this street food delight."
12,Veg Noodles ,3,"Veg noodles were decent, but the quantity of veggies was underwhelming. I'm all about that veggie goodness, and I felt like I was left wanting. The taste was alright, but a veggie overload would've made it so much better."
13,Tea ,4,"Tea was good, no two ways about it. A warm, comforting cup with just the right amount of sweetness and that distinct tea flavor. The serving size could have been a tad more generous, but nonetheless, a satisfying cuppa."

19,Fruit Juice ,4,"Fruit juice was refreshing and had a genuine fruity taste. However, it was slightly too sweet for my preference. Adjusting the sweetness level to a more natural sweetness would make it perfect."
20,Coffee ,5,"Coffee was exceptional, rich and aromatic, just the way I like it. It had the right balance of bitterness and the right kick of caffeine. A cup of this coffee sets the right tone for the day."
